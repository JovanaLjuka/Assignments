    <h1>New World</h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
        The term New World is often used to describe the majority of Earth's Western Hemisphere, including the
        Americas.[1] The term gained prominence in the early 16th century during Europe's Age of Discovery, shortly
        after the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci concluded that America, now often called the Americas, represented a
        new continent and subsequently published his findings in Mundus Novus, a Latin language pamphlet.[2] This
        realization expanded the geographical horizon of classical European geographers, who had thought until then that
        the world only included Africa, Europe, and Asia, which was collectively referred to as the Old World or
        Afro-Eurasia. The Americas were then referred to as "the fourth part of the world", or the "New World".[3]

    <h2>Origin of term</h2>

    <p>
        The Florentine explorer Amerigo Vespucci is usually credited for coming up with the term "New World" (Mundus
        Novus) for the Americas in his 1503 letter, giving it its popular cachet, although similar terms had nonetheless
        been used and applied before him.
